# Global-Superstore-data-visualization-using-PowerBI-dashboard
This is a PowerBI dashboard for visualizing a global superstore dataset. I have used bar charts, donut charts, cards, column charts, and a few slicers for filtering the data. I have also included a clear button for removing all the applied filters. I have used a little bit of DAX to create conditional columns Eg. 'Year'.
